# ConneKt - Unofficial (yet better) Sophos Client App

This project focusses on providing a better client side interface for Sophos Client Side Wifi Login Page in VITAP University

This app is not intended to be uploaded in playstore as the target audience is not huge enough.<br>
No worries , the app is equipped with an auto update feature and will notify you (if any updates found)

(**Not sure if it would work in other Sophos Backed Netwoks**)

# Extra Features
  (Apart from conventional login and logout)
  * **Smart Logout** : <br><br>

    When the wifi signal strenght drops below a set min threshold, the app automatically logout your wifi credentails to
    prevent your account from getting locked there
  
  * **Timer Logout** :<br><br>
    Just like alarm , your wifi credentials will be logged out automatically when it reaches the time you set
